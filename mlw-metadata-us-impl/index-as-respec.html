                  <li> The ITS 2.0 markup provides key information to drive the reliable extraction of translation-relevant
                     content from both XML
                     and HTML5.

                     is made available in the XLIFF package.
                     Thus, any XLIFF-enabled tool can make use of this information to provide translation
                     assistance.

                  <li> The implementation - the "Reviewer's Workbench" (a desktop application) - reads HTML,
                     XML and XLIFF files annotated with
                     ITS 2.0 metadata.
                     
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> At each segment of the original content, the ITS metadata is made accessible to reviewers.
                     Reviewers can adapt the access
                     via user-definable filter/formatting "rules". The metadata allows human reviewers
                     to make efficient decisions.
                     
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> During the review of translations, reviewers can add Localization Quality Issue annotations
                     (which are serialized as ITS
                     2.0 metadata when the file is saved). Provenance annotations are added in the background.

                     valuable data which can be used for
                     traditional business intelligence, or semantic web applications.

                     among XLIFF-aware components.

               <ol>
                  
                  <li> One of SOLAS components is an OKAPI based extra Extractor/Merger service that maps
                     ITS 2.0 categories onto XLIFF 1.2
                     
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> SOLAS is also integrated with CMS-L10N, can receive/return XLIFF jobs created by
                     CMS-L10N.

                  <li> CMS-L10N (aka LION) is basically a middleware component based on an RDF triple store
                     over an arbitrary CMS (tested with Alfresco,
                     Drupal and Wikimedia).
                     
                     
                  </li>
                  
               </ul>
               <ol>
                  
                  <li> Can parse the source including most of the ITS 2.0 metadata and produce XLIFF 1.2
                     according to a currently agreed mapping.
                     After the roundtrip, that is handled via SOLAS, it updates the RDF triple store accordingly.
                     
                     
                  </li>

               <ul>
                  
                  <li> The use of ITS 2.0 and XLIFF helps to modularize and connect specialized (single-purpose)
                     components.
                     
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> SOLAS can handle input of components aware of different ITS 2.0 categories or unaware
                     of ITS at all and combine them. SOLAS
                     orchestration ensures basic ITS compliance even with ITS unaware components. E.g.
                     If a service provider is unaware of the
                     translate flag, SOLAS can filter the translation request for that provider, so that
                     the flag is actually interpreted.

               <h2>  Description</h2>
               <p>Localization interoperability can be enhanced by using not just ITS 2.0 as standard.
                  In particular, the following standards
                  provide additional opportunities:
                  
                  
               </p>
               <ol>
                  
                  <li> OASIS Content Management Information Service (CMIS) to externally associate multiple
                     ITS 2.0 rules files with large sets
                     of documents, and to retrieve those documents regardless of the Content Management
                     System in use
                     
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> W3C Provenance (PROV) to track which human agents or software agents processed the
                     content; tracking can span multiple agents/components,
                     while allowing individual tracking records to be easily consolidated via linked data
                     approaches
                     
                     
                  </li>

               <p>Benefits:
                  
                  
               </p>
               <ul>
                  
                  <li> Enables ITS 2.0 annotations to be associated with multiple documents via the CMS
                     without editing individual files. This reduces
                     source content internationalization and document management costs. Furthermore, it
                     reduces annotation errors.
                     
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Allows fine-grained tracking and analysis of Language Technology (LT) components,
                     human agents (language workers) and service
                     providers - even across multiple organizations, projects, and heterogeneous process
                     landscapes. This reduces the overhead costs
                     in tracking, monitoring, analyzing and optimizing the localization workflows - especially
                     of the critical elements within
                     them (e.g. MT engines, human terminologists and translators)
                     
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Enables tracking of human linguistic judgments and their influence on the output
                     of LT components. Tracking data can be
                     curated for retraining/retuning those LT components (e.g. Statistical Machine Translation
                     or text analysis components)
                     
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Tracking information can be mapped to the W3C PROV Ontology (PROV-O) which expresses
                     the PROV Data Model using the OWL2 Web
                     Ontology Language (OWL2), and stored in Resource Description Framework (RDF) triple
                     stores.

               <ul>
                  
                  <li> Provenance - Tracks MT-based translation and translation revision through a post-editing
                     interface. Tracking is implemented
                     as standoff provenance records in XLIFF files. The post-editing records detail which
                     of the MT outputs was used if multiple
                     MT outputs are offered to the post-editor. The agent's ITS annotations (from translation
                     and translation revision) are mapped
                     to PROV-O triples in the accompanying RDF provenance logs.
                     
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Text analysis - Calls text analysis service (e.g. Enrycher) on source HTML file for
                     Named Entity Recognition annotations.
                     These annotations are also mapped into XLIFF files. This annotation results in logging
                     of activities performed on an 'analysed
                     text' entity in the PROV-O triple store.
                     
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Terminology - Allows text annotated by Named Entity Recognition, as well as other
                     phrases, to be identified as terms and
                     used to populate a multilingual glossary. If the text analysis annotation returns
                     a DBpedia reference, a query for the label
                     used in the equivalent target language page can be attempted to populate the term
                     target in the glossary. The terminology
                     annotation and the glossary are mapped to XLIFF as well as resulting in a 'term' entity
                     being tracked in the PROV-O provenance
                     logs.

                  <li> MT Confidence - This is used to annotate - in XLIFF - the assumed quality of output
                     of MT engines. MT Confidence is also
                     tracked for the translation entities generated by MT in the PROV-O logs.
                     
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Domain - Mapped from HTML source document to XLIFF, and used to annotate PROV-O entities
                     representing source units, i.e.
                     the source content of translation units.
                     
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> Translate - Mapped from HTML source document to XLIFF, and used to annotate PROV-O
                     entities representing source units, i.e.
                     the source content of translation units.

                     (amongst others since it provides
                     context to translators)

                     specific translations, transliterations, officially mandated translations, or even
                     keep the original.

                  <li> Automatic term candidate annotation can comprise:
                     
                     <ol>

                        <li> Annotation of the content by the two above-mentioned methods. The API breaks down
                           the content in Language and Domain dimensions
                           and uses terminology annotation services provided by the TaaS platform in order to
                           identify terms and link them with the TaaS
                           platform.

                     separately. This allows filtering terms
                     in the term bank-based terminology annotation as well as identifying domain-specific
                     content using unguided term extraction
                     systems. The user is asked to provide a default domain for the term bank-based terminology
                     annotation. This user-supplied
                     domain will be overridden with ITS 2.0 domain metadata if present in the content.

                     to provide a source (default) language, however, the default language will be overridden

               <p>ILO uses OKAPI capabilities for XLIFF handling and will be available in April 2013.
                  The use of ILO will be presented at the <a href="http://www.multilingualweb.eu/rome-showcase">MultilingualWeb Workshop March 2013</a>. The results of ILO development will be given back to the public domain under the
                  open licenses
                  LGPL V3 (same as Libre Office).

                  <li> ITS 2.0 bilingual data is collected in a Content Management System, and passed to
                     a Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)
                     system for training the system's language models.
                     
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  <li> If domain information is supplied for the content, domain-aware modules in the SMT
                     system are trained on the corresponding
                     content.
